My very first group project.

Developed data analysis that compares Zillow house prices with LANDSAT satellite imageries and air pollution data. 

Discovered 17.5 percent variance in housing-prices spread across nine different landscape-environments, providing evidence that different 
housing-environments can influence housing-prices.

Other project files mentioned at the end of the pdf file are available upon request.
